            <h2>Sports</h2>
            <p>
                I love the energy of playing basketball and tennis—whether it's a fast-paced game on the court or a powerful serve in a match. These sports keep me active and competitive. When I’m not playing, I’m watching football, enjoying the thrill of big plays, strategy, and intense moments. Whether on the court or cheering from the sidelines, sports are a huge part of my life!

            <p>My absolute favorite cuisine is Butter Chicken Pasta. I love how the rich, creamy sauce blends perfectly with the pasta and tender pieces of chicken. It's comfort food at its finest!</p>

            <p>One of my favorite places to visit is Greece. From the stunning beaches to the rich history, there’s something magical about the Greek islands. Whether it’s exploring ancient ruins or enjoying a beautiful sunset by the ocean, Greece never fails to impress.</p>

            <h2>Music</h2>
            <p>I’m a huge fan of artists like Drake and Mariah the Scientist. Their music speaks to me in different ways—whether it’s the storytelling in Drake’s lyrics or the emotional depth in Mariah’s melodies. Music is an essential part of my life, and I always find myself immersed in their tunes when I need a soundtrack for my day.</p>
